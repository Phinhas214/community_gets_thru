				<h2>Project Thesis</h2> 
				<p>"Community Gets Thru" is a project created to foster and build community. To many, this point in time 
					feels like an apocalypse! So many horrible things are happening and it is hard to cope
					with the immensity of it all. I created "Community Gets Thru" as a way to remind people that throughout history
					when times are thoughest, communities have always pulled through and got stuff done! This is a reminder that 
					all of our POC and LGBTQ communities have worked hard to get us where we are and we can continue
					by sharing community! This project's goal is to foster healing and understanding and not debate or 
					retraumatize. I am choosing not to specify what atrocities are going on because stepping back and focusing
					on yourself and your community can help so you're ready for the next fight ahead. Rest is Radical. Take your time.

				<h2>What is Community?</h2>
				<p>Community is a group of people that share a certain characteristic. What are
					some examples? Your school or work is a community. The people you practice your spiritual or religious 
					beliefs with are your community. Even your age group can be considered a community. You can also 
					be part of multiple communities at the same time! The term of community is more broad 
					than most would expect. But to have a deep connection with the people in your communities, everyone
					has to put in some effort and care.

				<h2>Our Get Together</h2>
				<p>The pictures here are from my community's get together. We all got to print the postcard, color, and decorate
					to our heart's extent. Please enjoy!

			<h2>Participate</h2> 
			<p>If you want to try this activity yourself, do it! Print out the 
				post card design and have your freinds, family, and other community
				members color and decorate. During or after decorating, start a 
				conversation about community.</p>
			<p>What if you don't feel like you have a community to do this activity with? 
				That's ok! Sometimes it's hard to find like minded people. But community 
				doesnt have to be people just like you. It can be people you regularly gather 
				with. There may be people around for you that don't come to mind quickly.
				What if I'm in a community that doesn't feel like it supports me? This happens
				a lot. Perhaps refelecting on these questions can help you find a people
				you share more with or who care about you needs and interests despite differences.</p>
			<p>These conversations can feel trivial or basic, but when you meditate and 
				really sit on these questions, you might realize something you don't expect.
				You might hear a perspective you've never heard. Or you can use these
				questions and your answers as afirmations on what to focus on in coming times.
