			<h2>Participate</h2> 
			<p>If you want to try this activity yourself, do it! Print out the 
				post card design and have your freinds, family, and other community
				members color and decorate. Durring or after decorating, start a 
				conversation about community. Here are some questions to discuss:</p>
			<p>What is your community? Who are the types of people in your community? What is 
				unique about my community? What is unique about my closest friends in your community?
				what makes the people in my community different from each other? What beliefs do your 
				community share and not share? What qualities does your community have that makes you happy, safe,
				valued, proud? What qualities does your community have that makes you worried, sad, unheard, unsafe?
				What types of ativities do you do in your community? What would you love to do in your community
				that hasn't been done? What are some traditions of your community? What is a new tradition you
				community could start? What is something your community does that you are looking forward to?</p>

			<p>What if you don't feel like you have a community to do this activity with? 
				That's ok! Sometimes it's hard to find like minded people. But community 
				doesnt have to be people just like you. It can be people you regularly gather 
				with. There may be people around for you that don't come to mind quickly.
				What if I'm in a community that doesn't feel like it supports me? This happens
				a lot. Perhaps refelecting on these questions can help you find a people
				you share more with or who care about you needs and interests despite differences.</p>
			<p>These conversations can feel trivial or basic, but when you meditate and 
				really sit on these questions, you might realize something you don't expect.
				You might hear a perspective you've never heard. Or you can use these
				questions and your answers as afirmations on what to focus on in coming times.
